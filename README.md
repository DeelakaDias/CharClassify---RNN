# CharClassify - RNN
<p>This repository contains implementations of character-level Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for tasks like language modeling and text classification. It features multiple models, including Uniform, Frequency-based, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models.</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Language Modeling: Computes metrics such as log-probability and perplexity of given text sequences.</li>
  <li>Text Classification: Differentiates between consonant- and vowel-related datasets using trained models.</li>
  <li>Customizable Vocabulary: Works with lowercase letters (a-z) and spaces.</li>
  <li>Dataset Evaluation: Evaluates models on training and development datasets./li>
</ul>
